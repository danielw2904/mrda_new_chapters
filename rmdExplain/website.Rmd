# Successful Homework completion

This page will guide you through creating and editing R-Markdown documents for your homework assignments. 

## Creating a new R-Markdown document

0. If an R-Markdown file was provided to you open it with R-Studio an skip to [step 4](#step4) after adding your answers.

1. Open R-Studio

2. Create a new R-Markdown document

![](./rmdExplain/enterName.PNG)
![](./rmdExplain/template.PNG)

3. Save with appropriate name
![](./rmdExplain/saving.PNG)

    3.1. Add your answers

    3.2. Save again

 <a name="step4"></a>

## Text and Equations

R-Markdown documents are plain text files that include both text and R-code. Using RStudio they can be converted ('knitted') to HTML or PDF files that include both the text and the results of the R-code. In fact this website is written using R-Markdown and RStudio. In order for RStudio to be able to interpret the document you have to use certain characters or combinations of characters when formatting text and including R-code to be evaluated. By default the document starts with the options for the text part. You can change the title, date, author and a few more advanced options.

### Headings

After that you can immediately start typing text. Usually you want to include some kind of heading first. A heading is created using `#` signs. A single `#` creates a first level heading, two `##` a second level and so on.

### Lists

You can create bullet point lists using `*`, `+` or `-`. Sub-items are created by indenting the item using 4 spaces or 2 tabs. 

````
* First Item
````

* First Item

````
* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item
````

* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item


In addition ordered lists can be created using numbers and letters. If you need sub-sub-items use `A)` instead of `A.` on the third level. 

````
1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item 
     b. second sub-item
2. Second item
````

1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item
    b. second sub-item
2. Second item

### Equations

Writing well formatted mathematical formulae is done the same way as in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). Math mode is started and ended using `$$`. Take a look at [this wikibook on Mathematics in LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Symbols) and [this list of Greek letters and mathematical symbols](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols) if you are not familiar with LaTeX. In addition check out the [LaTeX Math section](#latex-math) of this website.

````
$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$
````

$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$


(for those interested this is the spectral density of [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise))


### Text formatting

Text can be formatted in *italics* (`*italics*`) or **bold** (`**bold**`). In addition, you can ad block quotes with `>`

## R-Code

### Global options

The first chunk always looks as follows


    ```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    ```

It is added to the document automatically and sets options for all the following chunks. These options can be overwritten on a per-chunk basis. 

Keep `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` to print your code to the document you will hand in. Changing it to `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` will not print your code by default. This can be changed on a per-chunck basis.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

    ```{r cars, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```


```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)

plot(dist~speed, cars)
```

 
    ```{r cars2, echo = TRUE}`r ''`
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```


```{r cars2, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)

plot(dist~speed, cars)
```

## LaTeX Math

In order to write multi-line equations in the same math environment use `\\` after every line. In order to insert a space use a single `\`. To render text inside a math environment use `\text{here is the text}`. In order to align equations start with `\begin{align}` and place an `&` in each line at the point around which it should be aligned. Finally end with `\end{align}`

````
$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x
\end{align}
$$
````

$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x
\end{align}
$$

### Important symbols

````
$$
\begin{align}
1.&\ a^{2} + b\\
2.&\ a^{2+b} \\
3.&\ a_{1} \\
4.&\ a \leq b \\
5.&\ a \geq b \\
6.&\ a \neq b\\
7.&\ a \approx b \\
8.&\ a \in (0,1) \\
9.&\ a \rightarrow \infty\\
10.&\ \frac{a}{b}\\
11.&\ \frac{\partial a}{\partial b}\\
12.&\ \sqrt{a} \\
13.&\ \sum_{i = 1}^{b} a_i\\
14.&\ \int_{a}^b f(c) dc \\
15.&\ \prod_{i = 0}^b a_i \\
16.&\ c \left( \sum_{i=1}^b a_i \right) \text{ (adaptive paranthesis)} 
\end{align}
$$
````
$$
\begin{align}
1.&\ a^{2} + b\\
2.&\ a^{2+b} \\
3.&\ a_{1} \\
4.&\ a \leq b \\
5.&\ a \geq b \\
6.&\ a \neq b\\
7.&\ a \approx b \\
8.&\ a \in (0,1) \\
9.&\ a \rightarrow \infty\\
10.&\ \frac{a}{b}\\
11.&\ \frac{\partial a}{\partial b}\\
12.&\ \sqrt{a} \\
13.&\ \sum_{i = 1}^{b} a_i\\
14.&\ \int_{a}^b f(c) dc \\
15.&\ \prod_{i = 0}^b a_i \\
16.&\ c \left( \sum_{i=1}^b a_i \right) \text{ (adaptive parenthesis)} 
\end{align}
$$

The `{}` after `_` and `^` are not strictly necessary if there is only one character in the sub-/superscript. However, in order to place multiple characters in the sub-/superscript they are necessary. 
e.g.
````
$$
a^b = a^{b} \\
a^b+c \neq a^{b+c}\\
\sum_i a_i = \sum_{i} a_{i} \\
\sum_{i=1}^{b+c} a_i \neq \sum_i=1^b+c a_i
$$
````
$$
a^b = a^{b} \\
a^b+c \neq a^{b+c} \\
\sum_i a_i = \sum_{i} a_{i} \\
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{b+c} a_i\right) \neq \left(\sum_i=1^b+c a_i\right)
$$

### Greek letters

[Greek letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters) are preceded by a `\` followed by their name (`$\beta$` = $\beta$). In order to capitalize them simply capitalize the first letter of the name (`$\Gamma$` = $\Gamma$).
